Ultimately, the thing thats motivating me to change my career is the desire to provide a better life for my partner and I. A greater salary is obviously a part of that... but it's everything that comes with it: a job that makes me happy with work that I enjoy doing, the possibility of good benefits, and a better work/life balance to allow us to actually enjoy our lives before we get too old to enjoy them.
